## Hi there, I'm Phoenix! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a student studying for an associates in Networking Systems Management Technology.
I often find myself bored with what I'm offered alone by my college, so I often take it upon myself to learn new things on my own every day!
Currently my main focuses are my pseudo-brand "PhoenixNet" and my homelab.

My Homelab | A Picture of my Homelab.
I've come a long way with my lab since 2016! And I'm very proud of what I've done with it! I've learned alot of technologies along the way, and it's definately helped me decide where I want to take my career. As of now (last commit) I have 3 servers in my lab, all Dell EMC Poweredge-grade servers; R310, R410 and a generously donated R710. I also run all Ubiquiti hardware in terms of networking. I run a VMware lab, so everything is ESXi / vSphere / vCenter in terms of hypervirtualization. Within, I run an absolute grab-bag of different OS's and pieces of software to meet my needs as I learn and expand my knowledge. | ![Lab Picture](/images/labimagerounded.png)
